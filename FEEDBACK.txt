FEEDBACK:

Good implementation of class Country. 
    Consider leveraging the toString() method of class SubscriptionYear 
    instead of directly calling the accessor method.


Good testing of your implementation.


-1 Incomplete implementation of class Country getNumSubscriptionsForPeriod() method 
   should output the total subscriptions if an existing year exists within the requested
   range instead of just outputting an error message
    "Error: Both starting year and ending year are out of range."
   See excerpt from project description: 
	" getNumSubscriptionsForPeriod() method ...
	  NOTE: If the client requests an invalid start or an invalid end year, only 
	  return the total for the range within the requested year that is valid."
  
  Next time minus two for this.
  
-Bita.
